cc65
- ability to inline specific callsites of function: a= INLINE(slowfunc(b))

sim65:
- conio (no have?), no clrscr, etc... maybe assume VT100?
- clock_t clock (void); missing on sim65
- any variables from which I can deduce size of program *inside* the program, CODE, RODATA, DATA, RSS?
- a realtime approximation flag would be nice, too see how slow it would be
- an option setting --clock=2M could make more time functions simulated
