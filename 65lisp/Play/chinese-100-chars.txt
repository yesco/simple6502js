1. Structure of Chinese Characters
Each Chinese character is a composition of strokes and patterns. The building blocks of these characters are radicals, which often indicate the character’s semantic meaning or function. Radicals can help you decipher the meaning of complex characters and aid in categorization.

Characters are made up of several strokes, whose correct sequence is crucial for writing legibly and traditionally. Understanding the basic strokes—such as horizontal (一), vertical (丨), left-falling (丿), and right-falling (丶)—is the first step in learning to write.

2. Types of Mandarin Characters
Characters can be phonetic, carrying sound information, or semantic, conveying meaning. A significant aspect of learning Hanzi is distinguishing between these components to enhance memorization and comprehension.

The distinction between Simplified and Traditional characters is also vital, especially for learners dealing with varied texts from Mainland China, Taiwan, or historical literature. Simplified characters use fewer strokes and are commonly used in Mainland China, whereas Traditional characters are prevalent in Taiwan and Hong Kong.

Techniques for Learning Chinese Characters
1. Memorization Techniques
Learning Chinese characters can be daunting due to their complexity. Associative learning—linking characters with visual images or stories—can significantly aid memorization. Additionally, regular repetition practice is indispensable for retaining what you’ve learned, and employing spaced repetition enhances long-term memory of characters.

2. Writing Techniques
Proper stroke order is not just about tradition; it helps learners write faster and more intuitively. For practice, tools like brush pens or apps that simulate the writing experience can be extremely helpful. Websites offering structured practice sessions are invaluable resources for beginners.
